# Fetch Hackathon - Trivia quiz game

In a pair and during a 4 hour hackathon, my partner and I wanted to create a trvia quiz game that both looked good and was fun and competitive. We had to use vanilla javascript and this was during the second week we actually started getting into code so it was sort of all new to us. We were and still are passionate about coding so we took to it and created [this game](https://trivia-quiz-game.netlify.app/)

We used opentdb's trivia api and recieved 3 incorrecr answers in one array and 1 correct in another from the api. We then took to placing them in one array and assigning them to `<li>` tags so users can interact with them but also wrote a function which shuffles location of the correct/incorrect answers as to make them appear in a differnt choice option everytime. The game also informs the player of the correct/incorrect answer when they make their choice. It's a fun and competitive game that was done with a heart full of passion and little time.
